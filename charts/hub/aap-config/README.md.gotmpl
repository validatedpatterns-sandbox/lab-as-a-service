This chart is used to set up the Ansible Automation Platform Operator version 2.5.

### Notable changes

* v0.1.2: Introduce EXTRA_PLAYBOOK_OPTS to config job, to allow for extra vars and
-v options (usually -vvv) to be passed to playbook to help debug it

* v0.1.3: Introduce "bootstrap" phase; this means that the config job will run until
it succeeds, and only then proceed to create the cronjob to re-configure. It also
means the cronjob scheduling is nowehere near as aggressive (every even hour at
the 10-minute mark instead of every ten minutes as previously).

* v0.1.4: Use vp-rbac subchart to configure RBACs instead of local code. Introduce
external secrets validation job to prevent argo from proceeding past ES creation and
erroring out early.
